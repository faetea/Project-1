### Need to do:

Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete.  What kind of data front-end needs to store/manipulate to function?  Write out english user stories for app.  Write JS code to manage game logic


1. player 1 chooses icon, game remembers that icon to represent player 1
2. player 2 chooses different icon, game remembers that icon to represent player 2
3. player 1 clicks square, game places P1 icon in square
4. player 2 clicks square, game places P2 icon in square
5. players continue
6. as soon as either player has 3 icons in a row, game annouces game finished!
7. game annouces score and winner
