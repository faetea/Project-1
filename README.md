### Data Objects/Nouns:

player 1
- name
- choice of icon
player 2
- name
- choice of icon
game board
- 9 squares & who moved in each square



### User Stories:

**Story 1**
As a player, I can enter my name. (done)

**Story 2**
As the scoreboard, assign an icon. (done)

**Story 3**
As a player, I can click on game board squares to claim them.

**Story 4**
As the scoreboard, when there are 3 squares in a row the game is finished

**Story 5**
As the scoreboard, when game is finished, annouce scores and winner.

**Story 6**
As the game, when score is annouced, ask "Play Again?"



### Game Logic:

players each enter names, game remembers player names
player 1 chooses icon, game remembers that icon to represent player 1
player 2 chooses different icon, game remembers that icon to represent player 2
player 1 clicks square, game places P1 icon in square
player 2 clicks square, game places P2 icon in square
players continue
as soon as either player has 3 icons in a row, game annouces game finished!
game annouces score and winner
game asks "play again?"
