### Game Logic:

1. Game prompts "What is your name?",  Player 1 enters name (or placeholder name is used)
1. Game alerts "(player-name or placeholder), you are the first player.  Your team is the Daleks!"
1. For player 2, Game prompts "What is your name?",  Player 2 enters name (or placeholder name is used)
1. Game alerts "(player-name or placeholder), you are the second player.  Your team is the Doctor!"
1. Game assigns Dalek icon to Player 1,  and displays Player 1 name on the scoreboard
1. Game assigns Tardis icon to Player 2,  and displays Player 2 name on the scoreboard
1. Player 1 clicks square,  Game checks if there is already a piece in that square, if empty, places player 1 icon in square
1. Game uses 'var = whoseTurn' and 'function switchTurn()' to keep track of whose turn it is
1. Player 2 takes turn,  Game checks if there is already a piece in that square, if empty, places player 2 icon in square
1. Repeat
1. Game uses 'function getWinner()' to know when win state has been reached (three of same icons form a row)
1. Once win state is reacted Game knows to set 'whoseTurn = 3' so that neither players icons can be placed anymore
1. Game alerts "Game Over! (winner-name) has won!",  Confirms "Do you want to play again?",  Re-opens 'index.html'
