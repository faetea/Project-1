Start thinking about what kind of data your front-end will need to store and manipulate in order to work correctly.

Nouns:

player 1
  name
  choice of icon
player 2
  name
  choice of icon
game board
  9 squares
    who moved in each square



Write out some user stories for the app

Story
As a player, I can enter my name.
  player === noun/data object
  enter === verb/function
  name === adjective/data property

Story
As the scoreboard, assign an icon.

Story
As a player, I can click on game board squares to claim them.

Story
As the scoreboard, when there are 3 squares in a row the game is finished

Story
As the scoreboard, when game is finished, annouce scores and winner.

Story
As the game, when score is annouced, ask "Play Again?"



create the code to manage your game logic.

Game Logic:

players each enter names, game remembers player names
player 1 chooses icon, game remembers that icon to represent player 1
player 2 chooses different icon, game remembers that icon to represent player 2
player 1 clicks square, game places P1 icon in square
player 2 clicks square, game places P2 icon in square
players continue
as soon as either player has 3 icons in a row, game annouces game finished!
game annouces score and winner
game asks "play again?"
