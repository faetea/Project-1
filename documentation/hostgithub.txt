repo linked to github
create an index.html file (+ other files, potentially)
commit the code to your repo
create a branch locally called 'gh-pages'
if necessary, merge your (finished) site into the 'gh-pages' branch, so that the gh-pages branch and your integration branch look the same
push your gh-pages branch up to GitHub
site should now be visible
