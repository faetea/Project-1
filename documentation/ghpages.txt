1. Repo linked to github
2. Create an index.html file (+ other files, potentially)
3. Commit the code to your repo
4. Create a branch locally called 'gh-pages'
5. If necessary, merge your (finished) site into the 'gh-pages' branch, so that the gh-pages branch and your integration branch look the same
6. Push your gh-pages branch up to GitHub
7. Site should now be visible
